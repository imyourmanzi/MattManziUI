**Opportunity:** Every software engineer needs a personal website, or something like that.

**Solution:** A personal website to showcase my work, and also a platform for me to explore new web technologies that catch my eye.

**Tech Highlight:** Probably the most interesting aspect is that this website has transformed from pure HTML/CSS running on bare metal nginx to using the latest Svelte framework and hosting it on GCP.

**Takeaways:** Solving the technical problems of this project helped prepare me for a career in software development.
