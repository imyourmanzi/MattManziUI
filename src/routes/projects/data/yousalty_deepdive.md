### Prologue

I had tried iOS development before. In the summer of 2012, I got my first MacBook. With it, I was trying out all the coveted Apple software—Photo Booth, GarageBand, Final Cut Pro, and the like—that could only be enjoyed on a macOS system. Also, around that time, my dad floated the idea to me of building his time management app (see above). For those that follow iOS, you might recall Objective-C was the then-uncontested, merciless king of app development for Apple. I trudged through countless tutorials and examples, designing several versions of his app, but all the while never producing anything complete or functional. At 14, I lacked the understanding of basic programming concepts, and I sure as heck was not learning them through Xcode and [block syntax](http://goshdarnblocksyntax.com).

### So, what is it?

> Spice up your conversation by letting your friends know they're being a little "salty!”

You could say that the whole experience started with me feeling a little “[salty](https://www.yourtango.com/self/what-does-salty-mean-slang-term-origin),” but when a friend jokingly asked me to make him a salt shaker app to realize the full potential of this slang term, he didn’t think it would happen. Little did he know that I’d been reading up on Swift and doing everything I could to bring my first app to life, and now he gave me the perfect idea.

A simple salt shaker app is more than meets the eye. In addition to the interface, I had to determine and implement the animation, design and animate all of the graphics, and integrate it with the OS “shake” gesture. There was specifically a lot of trial and error around the animation timing to make the shakes seem somewhat natural.

And once I had it working just the way I wanted, it was time for the App Store review. Apple is known for wanting apps on their store to have “[clean, refined, and user-friendly interfaces](https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/#substandard)” among other things, and they’re not afraid to let you know. After ten days of waiting, I got that rite of passage for every mobile app dev: “Your app submission has been rejected.” In short, the initial version had only one screen and didn’t really provide the user with any context, so I can see where they were coming from. But to true to their word, I made the suggested changes and received approval. We were ready to set sail!

Below are the final screenshots of the salt shaker app (which would eventually include pepper) that launched my career in software development.
