It’s Time To Go was the “magnum opus” of my high school career. Everything I knew about technology, software, and app design went into making this app. While the core idea is credited to my father, I personally designed and produced every other part of the app. From code to colors to calendar integration, I worked through each feature from inception to delivery. Over the five years that I developed and maintained the project, I experienced what it was like to design a minimum viable product (MVP), iterate on it, and eventually overhaul it.

### `let i = 0`

The initial release focused on only one target market: frequent flyers. Instead of an anthropomorphized clock, the icon was just the outline of an airplane overlaid on something that looked like a compass or clock with too many tick marks. The simple interface dropped the user immediately into the workflow. It had few enough options that learning the app was still intuitive.

This design did remain the foundation for the app’s lifespan—and indeed this MVP received seven incremental updates over the first two years—but it would need to be overhauled if it was going to appeal to a wider audience.

### Version 2.0

In December 2017, version 2.0 was ready for release. After revisiting old ideas, exploring aspects of the latest iOS, and incorporating feedback from users, this _nth_ iteration was finally embodying the full potential of the simple time management principle it was based on. The user interface added a more general introduction to the same original layout. With it, came 30+ default scenarios & schedules for users to better understand how universal the app could be.

</div>

Here’s an example of how I’ve personally used the app for more than just catching flights. For context, I was helping a friend-of-a-friend bring a stray kitten he’d found to a local shelter, since he was leaving the country that day. I already had the prior engagement of going to the climbing gym so my schedule got a bit more complex when I was called on for this favor.
