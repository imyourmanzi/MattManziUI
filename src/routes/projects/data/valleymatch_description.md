**Opportunity:** Raise money for my high school robotics team.

**Solution:** A “friendship matching” program where students, using a custom personality matchmaking program, can get paired with others that they’re likely to be friends with.

**Tech Highlight:** A Java + MySQL batch process ingesting data from Google Forms.

**Takeaway:** I thought the most important thing in software development was code. That was until I learned about getting stakeholder sign-off.
