**Opportunity:** Raise money for my high school robotics team.

**Solution:** A “friendship matching” program where students, using a custom personality matchmaking program, can get paired with others that they’re likely to be friends with.

**Tech Highlight:** A Java + MySQL batch process ingesting data from Google Forms.

**Takeaway:** Software development was hard until I learned about getting stakeholder sign-off. This was the first time I had to prove to someone that the product I was building was actually worth supporting (and they didn’t even have to pay for it).
