        I have maintained this site since 2015, where I originally used it to host "lesson
        downloads" for a students I tutored in my senior year of high school. That, and
        showcase my high school fixation on narwhals (more below).

      <p>
        Over the years, I taught myself (varying degrees of fluency in) different web
        technologies. Since this is the deep dive, I get to list them all out.

      <h3>Really Nerdy Stuff</h3>

      <p>
        Owing to the fact that I started off learning just HTML and CSS (and for a while
        stubbornly refused to learn JavaScript), I picked up a trick that I thought was
        pretty cool back in high school: <a
          href="https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/"
          >CSS <code>@media</code> queries</a
        >. Two in particular have stood the test of time throughout the many iterations of
        the codebase.
      </p>

      <div class="multiColumn">
        <div>
          <h4>Color Scheme</h4>
          <p>
            It is my personal opinion‚Äîand I‚Äôm sure many of you will agree‚Äîthat every
            modern application should not only have light and dark themes, but also adhere
            to the user‚Äôs preference. In recent years, this can be done almost
            effortlessly with browsers pulling color scheme preference from the operating
            system and then passing it along to this media query.
          </p>
          <CodeBlock
            language="css"
            code="{`/* Default colors for dark mode */
body {
  background-color: #011f3a;
  color: white;
  font-weight: 400;
}

a {
  color: #97b0ca;
}

/* Modifications for light mode */
@media screen and (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: #fcfbf7;
    color: #011f3a;
  }

  a {
    color: #277ad3;
  }
}`}"
          />
          <p>
            What you see above is an excerpt of CSS from this site. Global colors are set
            for text in the <code>body</code> and <code>a</code> tags. Then, a media query
            watches for when the user‚Äôs device is set to light mode and applies the
            overriding styles. This makes it extremely useful for users whose devices are
            set to ‚Äúauto‚Äù and will transition from light to dark around sunset (a setting
            I
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ieq5sNEoc1E"> highly recommend</a>).
            This CSS will ensure that site visitors never miss a beat and they don‚Äôt have
            to fiddle with an individual toggle for the website. And finally, it‚Äôs a
            JS-free solution that works on
            <a href="https://caniuse.com/prefers-color-scheme">all modern browsers</a>.

          <h4>Aspect Ratio</h4>
          <p>
            When I started building my website, ‚Äúmobile-first design‚Äù was a big buzzword
            and I was not going to be left out. üò§¬†So, with the CSS-only chip on my
            shoulder, I set out to find a solution that would solve my mobile-first woes.
            Media queries gives us access to a number of details about the device screen,
            but my favorite is the <a
              href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_media_aspect-ratio"
              ><code>aspect-ratio</code></a
            >.
          </p>
          <CodeBlock
            language="css"
            code="{`#navigationLinks {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  flex-wrap: nowrap;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  align-items: center;
}

/* Extra tall and skinny screens (i.e. smartphones) */
@media screen and (max-aspect-ratio: 767/1024) {
  #navigationLinks {
    justify-content: space-around;
  }
}`}"
          />
          <p>
            A common first pass at solving the mobile-first design problem was to pick a
            screen resolution width that couldn‚Äôt possibly be computer (because it would
            have such small value) so it must be a phone. However, at the time, mobile
            screens were boasting increasingly higher resolutions. Between that, certain
            operating system settings to tweak effective screen size, and tablets, it was
            near impossible to pick one number and have your website look how you wanted
            it to on most devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enter <code>max-aspect-ratio</code>, which redefined the problem statement. It
            wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúis this screen big or small?‚Äù but rather ‚Äúis it wide or tall?‚Äù Now,
            elements that needed to be shifted due to width constraints could know the
            exact point where they should start saving width over height. And if you‚Äôre
            wondering about the obscure <code>767/1024</code> ratio, it was inspired by the
            aspect ratio of my iPhone 5S at the time.

      <h3>Time Capsule</h3>

      <p>
        Here's a snapshot of my a page from my original site in its infancy. Remember how
        I said ‚Äúfixation on narwhals‚Äù? Well, the domain used to be <code
          >narwhalsandcode[.]com</code
        >. At this point in the timeline, I didn't understand JavaScript and the whole
        website was me using just HTML and CSS to build everything from scratch.
        Unfortunately, all that code is lost to time since I didn‚Äôt really start
        understanding git until I
