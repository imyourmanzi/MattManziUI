# MattManzi.com

This repository compiles into the relevant front-end resources needed for my personal website at [mattmanzi.com](https://mattmanzi.com).

As of July 2024, the front-end is the only active project for the site. Infrastructure-as-code needed to host it on GCP/Firebase are included in this project for simplicity.

## Background

Every software engineer needs a personal website, or something like that. This website is how I showcase my work but also a platform for me to explore new web technologies that catch my eye. I have maintained this site since 2015, where I originally used it to host "lesson downloads" for a students I tutored in my senior year of high school. Over the years, I taught myself (varying degrees of) basic HTML+CSS, npm, JavaScript, Vue 1.x–3.x, Svelte 1.x–3.x, TypeScript, git, Linux CLI and scripting, nginx, Apache, Ansible, Django, ASP.NET, GCP/Firebase, and Terraform.

I have to hide this in here because it's hideous. At this point in the timeline, I didn't understand JavaScript and the whole website was me using just HTML and CSS to build everything from scratch.
